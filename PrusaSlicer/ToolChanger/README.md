**DO NOT change anything in this directory unless you know what you are doing!!**

The contents of this directory is automatically generated by GitHub actions and is simply [ToolChanger.ini](/PrusaSlicer/ToolChanger.ini) broken out into a standard config directory structure.

You can test this config without importing [ToolChanger.ini](/PrusaSlicer/ToolChanger.ini) by using the `--datadir` option, such as:

```
"C:\Program Files\PrusaSlicer-2.3.0\prusa-slicer.exe" --datadir "C:\dev\ToolChangerSlicer\PrusaSlicer\ToolChanger"
```

*Please note that currently you **must** use PrusaSlicer 2.3.0 which, as of 12/27/2020 is a release candidate.*

Note that it seems that PrusaSlicer does not like `--datadir` to have dashes in the name, so you must clone this repo to a different directory name such as:

```
git clone git@github.com:e3donline/Slicer-Profiles.git ToolChangerSlicer
```

**User beware:** Nearly all files and directories here will be overwritten on the next commit to [ToolChanger.ini](/PrusaSlicer/ToolChanger.ini) so please be aware that any changes made may not survive, including if you use this config directly (as described above) and save config changes then pull latest from the repo.
